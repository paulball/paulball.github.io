						<h2>The problem:</h2>
						<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted how much we use the technology around us, as well as how we maintain our health, both physical and mental. With lockdown restrictions and social distancing, we must refrain from team sports, going to the gym, social gatherings, etc., which all keep us healthy in one way or another. With this, there is also a huge increase in time spent online and on our devices, for work, social interaction through FaceTime or texting, entertainment, or the news. However, this was also a growing issue before the pandemic, where research was being done to see if screen time can impact your health. Thus, it is important to manage our time spent on our devices and even use them to our advantage to maintain our health and well being. The various ways of doing this include fitness and workout applications, diet trackers, digital journals, guided meditations, schedule organizers, etc. In this sense, we will be exploring a mobile application design where one can manage the different aspects of their health in one portal.

						<p>Mood Trackers/Journals: <br>Daylio Journal: Daylio Journal is a digital journal made to do what you want it to. It provides the liberty of choice in what aspects of your life you want to track. This, however, also means that there is no “push” to get you to track any specific aspect of your life, unless you already know which ones you want to track. It does have in-depth statistics on your health and mood over time if you fill it out consistently. It uses a lot of icons for data input and representation, as well as graphs for showing your progress. Covers: Mood tracking, mindfulness, tracking based on user input.</p>

							<h2>Data analysis</h2>
							<p>The survey we wrote was designed to really understand the current problems that people were facing since the start of the pandemic. As can be seen in the following two graphs (where 1 is no effect and 5 is a large effect), the majority of people report at least some effects on their health.</p>

						<h2>Data analysis:</h2>
						<p>When asked about how the pandemic has affected their physical health, most people reported that they were unable to go to the gym or participate in team/organized sporting activities, making them less active and prone to weight gain. Some also report effects on their sleep cycle (both more and less sleep), as well as less personal care and nutrition.

							<br>When asked what tools they use to track their physical health or diet, many mention using a scale to track their weight. A few specifically reference MyFitnessPal for diet tracking, and others mention the use of a smart watch, a fitness band, or a notebook (both digital and physical). Some people do not track their physical health at all.

							<br>When asked about how the pandemic affected their mental health, many report feeling isolated or alone, feeling constrained in a singular environment, and having less contact with friends, specifically.
							<br>When asked what tools they use to track their mental health, if they do, and most responded that they simply do not track their mental health. The ones who said otherwise said they try to use a journal (digital or physical), but not consistently.

							<br>When asked about the tracking of chores and tasks, most either do not track their chores or use the built in services on their phone (calendar or notepad) to track the things they need to do.

							<br>When asked how they keep themselves busy during the pandemic, most people cited being on their phone, on social media, or watching Netflix/YouTube much more. This, in conjunction with the previous findings, lead us to want to design an application that really focuses on the health of the user. Many users reporting that they do not track their mental health, and only track their physical health through a scale, means that there is a void of proper care during this time. The application we are designing attempts to fill that by creating a “one stop shop” for health. This, with a calm and supportive environment on the application itself, will hopefully make users more willing to try out the application and stay around.
